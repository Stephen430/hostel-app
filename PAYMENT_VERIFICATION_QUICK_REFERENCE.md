# Payment Verification Quick Reference

## Quick Start

### Test the System

**As a Paid Student:**
- Login with: CS/2020/001 or CS/2020/002
- Navigate to Rooms tab → See all available rooms
- Click any room → View details and book

**As an Unpaid Student:**
- Login with any other matric number
- Navigate to Rooms tab → See payment required screen
- Click "Make Payment" → Complete payment flow
- After payment → Immediate access granted

## Key Components

### PaymentGate Component
```typescript
import { PaymentGate } from "@/components/PaymentGate";

// Wrap protected content
<PaymentGate>
  {/* Your protected content */}
</PaymentGate>
```

### Check Payment Status
```typescript
const { hasValidPayment } = useReservation();
const hasPaid = hasValidPayment(user.matricNumber);
```

### Add Payment Record
```typescript
const { addPaymentRecord } = useReservation();

addPaymentRecord({
  payment_id: "PAY-123",
  student_matric_no: "CS/2020/123",
  amount: 50000,
  payment_method: "card",
  payment_status: "confirmed",
  transaction_reference: "TRX-456",
  payment_date: new Date(),
  description: "Initial hostel payment"
});
```

## Protected Pages

- ✅ Rooms Page (`app/(tabs)/rooms.tsx`)
- ✅ Room Details Page (`app/room-details.tsx`)

## Payment Flow

1. Student attempts to access rooms
2. System checks payment status
3. If unpaid → Show payment gate
4. Student clicks "Make Payment"
5. Complete payment details
6. System creates payment record
7. Immediate access granted

## Payment Record Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| payment_id | string | Unique identifier |
| student_matric_no | string | Student's matric number |
| amount | number | Payment amount |
| payment_method | string | card/bank_transfer/cash/online |
| payment_status | string | confirmed/pending/failed |
| transaction_reference | string | Transaction ref |

## Context Functions

### useReservation()

```typescript
const {
  paymentRecords,      // All payment records
  hasValidPayment,     // Check if student paid
  addPaymentRecord     // Add new payment
} = useReservation();
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with CS/2020/001 → Should see rooms
