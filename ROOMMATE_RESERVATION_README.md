## ðŸš€ How It Works

### For Students Making Reservations:

1. **Book your bed first** in your desired room (REQUIRED)
2. **Browse the same room** where you have a booking
3. **Select another available bed** in that room
4. **Tap "Reserve"** button (only appears if you have a bed in this room)
5. **Enter roommate's matric number** and choose duration (3-5 days)
6. **Track the reservation** in My Booking > Reservations tab
7. See **countdown timer** showing time remaining

**Important:** You can ONLY reserve beds in the SAME ROOM where you already have a booking. This ensures roommates stay together!

### For Roommates Confirming:

1. **Log in** with your matric number
2. See **orange alert** on home page if you have pending reservations
3. **Tap notification** or alert banner
4. View **reservation details** and time remaining
5. **Tap "Confirm Reservation"**
6. Bed is now yours! View in My Booking > My Rooms tab

### Automatic Expiry:

- System **checks every minute** for expired reservations
- When time runs out:
  - Reservation status â†’ **expired**
  - Bed space status â†’ **available**
  - Space becomes **bookable by anyone**
